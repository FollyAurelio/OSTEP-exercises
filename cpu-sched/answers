1)FIFO and SJF job 0 : tt = 200s, rt = 0s
	job 1 : tt 400s, rt = 200s
	job 2 : tt = 600s, rt = 400s

2)
FIFO
job 0 : tt = 100s, rt = 0s
job 1 : tt = 300s, rt = 100s
job 2 : tt = 600s, rt = 300s

SJF 
job 0 : tt = 100s, rt = 0s
job 1 : tt = 300s, rt = 100s
job 2 : tt = 600s, rt = 300s

3)
RR
job 0 : tt = 298s, rt = 0s
job 1 : tt = 499s, rt = 1s
job 2 : tt = 600s, rt = 2s

4)In cases where the jobs that arrive on the system are ordered from shortest to longest

5)SJF delivers the same response time as RR if the time slice of the RR only ever occurs the moment a job has finished, or is larger than the length of all the jobs combined

6)The response time of the largest job becomes poor

7)The response time becomes longer, the worst case response time for a time slice t and n jobs in RR is : t * (n -1)
